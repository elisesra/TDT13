The runner-up team in 1974 was the Netherlands, and the key player often associated with that team is Johan Cruyff. However, since the question asks specifically for the second-place finisher, not a player, my answer should be the team name.

Please clarify if you want the team name or a player, but based on the question, the team is the Netherlands. If you request a player, it would be Johan Cruyff.
